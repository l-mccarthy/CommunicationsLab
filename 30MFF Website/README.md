# 30MFF Website - _Moving Forward_

### Project Description:



### Process:

First step in implementing the concept was creating a basic wireframe. I decided on 4 separate pages for my website to organise the bits of information I wanted the user to read/watch and to keep it minimal so as to not overwhelm them, as well as keep the emphasis on the film itsef.

**Basic Wireframe:**

The first page is the home page and I wanted it to be solely on the film itself because this is a website advertising a film after all, visitors open the website with the purpose of watching the film. I also planned to have the logo be a link to the home page, which means two items can be interacted with on the navbar to take the user to the film.

The next page will likely be the most dense as it contains text and images on the three people who created the film. This page is important as it gives a human element to the film, reminding the user that real people made this.

The third page is next as it outlines why the film was made and what we did to enahnce the cinematic experience, hopefully this can make the user appreciate the film greater.

The final page is for more information on the film, though not essential. Such as pictures of behind the scenes (which will be made into a carousel/slideshow) and the more technical details.
